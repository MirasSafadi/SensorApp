# SensorApp (still in progress)
This is a simple android app that displays real time data from various sensors such as light, pressure, proximity, position and compass.
It displays errors if there's a problem reading one of the sensors and tells exactly what sensor is causing trouble.
things that will be added later:
1) a log that displays the status of the sensors.
2) some UI improvements.
3) some tweaks here and there.
This file will later inlcude diagrams and screenshots of the app.
